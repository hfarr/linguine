# Linguine! 

### They're good for you

## Whomst?

This is a discord base linguine tracking system, custom built
for the Official Qitta Fan Club (OQFC). More information on
linguine's can be found on the shared google drive for members.

Linguines are tracked by two counters per individual. 

- The "points" counter ranges from 0 to 100. When the takes get
    too spicy and/or disrespectful, and informal consensus of
    OQFC members can assign an agreed upon number of points
    (typically in increments of 5). These can be officially
    counted on discord by typing

    ```
    !points <discord @ of person> <number of points>
    ```

    For example, `!points @fredo 15` assigns Henry 15 points.
    This counter resets daily at 4AM back to 0, and after
    reaching 100 (whichever comes first).

- The "linguine" counter increments for an individual when the
    first counters reaches or exceeds 100, indicating they've
    earned a linguine. This action also triggers an announcement
    in the `#linguine-tracker` channel.

    Only designated OQFC members can remove linguines from this
    counter.


## Ideas

- Track "unresolved" linguines separately"
    - Document their resolution (date, activity)
    - Weekly reminders for outstanding linguines

- Automatic birthday linguines

- Web panel
    - Overview of linguine state
    - administrative actions
